## 🚧 Currently Working On

This project is **in active development**.  
Right now, the frontend is completed with a basic layout and functionality:

- Users can enter C++ code in a text area.
- Clicking **Run Code** sends the code to the backend using a `POST` request.
- Waiting for backend logic to be fully implemented (compile & run code).

**Stay tuned!** 🔧
